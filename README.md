## Description
MAL Reviewer is an unofficial productivity booster application that organizes and simplifies writing Anime and Manga reviews for [MyAnimeList](https://myanimelist.net/). For you out there who like to keep records of their reviews on a local drive, you can finally ditch the lengthy manual process of managing your reviews in separate text files and take advantage of MAL reviewer and its wide range of tools.
